# NakFit @ Noizucon-2024

<h2>What is this project about?</h2>
<h4>NakFit</h4>
<p>
  This is a video game project titled NakFit. The player need to control their in-game character to jump between platforms. Since this project is under Noizucon's health gaming label, a motion sensor input will be added later.
</p>
<h4>Controls</h4>
<p>
  Player need to hold the jump key (in early development, a space key) to fill up the force meter and release it when the meter reach their desired value. When the motion sensor implemented later, instead of the traditional key bind, player need to squat to fill up the meter and stand to release it.
</p>
<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>
  Player need to jump on next platform while avoiding enemies as well as collecting in-game points to gain score. Reach maximum number of score to clear the game. The player however can continue the game even after reaching the maximum score to record their highest score.
</p>
<h4>Winning and Losing Conditions</h4>

    <li>Gain max score</li>
  </ol>
